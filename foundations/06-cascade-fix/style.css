  The rule before was:

  Because the specificity of .para and .small-para are the same, 
  the former rule was being picked up as it comes later in the file.
  For this reason, I used the chaining method to increase the specificity
  of the rule targeting .small-para.

/*
  The rule before was:

  .confirm {

  Because the specificity of .confirm and .button are the same,
  some of the latter rule's declarations were overriding the former rule's
  declarations. As such, I used the ID selector to increase the specificity 
  of the rule targetting the confirm button.

  Because child elements inherit style declarations of parent elements,
  .child's rule declarations were being overidden. By adding .text before 
  .child, I used the descendant combinator method to target .child's text.
